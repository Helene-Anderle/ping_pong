# ping_pong
play ping pong, theres a padel on the left side operated with the w and s keys and one on the right side operated with the up and down keys. If you hit it with your padel you get a point, if you miss it the other side gets a point.
Goes to 10, whoever gets there first wins. Also, as the player on the right side goes first, they have an advantage. Such is life.
